# VLSI-MINI-PROJECTS
## CMOS Inverter Design using esim
**_The motive of this project is to understand the basics of a cmos inverter designing and get a hands on the opensource design tools._** 
**The design tools used:**  
**esim**-To designing the schamitic.  
**ngspice**-  
**Magic**- For layout designing.  
**NetGen**- For Layout vs schamitic(LVS).  
**OpenTimer**- For Static timing analysis.   
_I have downloaded all the above tools by the following tutorial :  
And a very excillent site to learn these tools is the : opencircuit.com.
